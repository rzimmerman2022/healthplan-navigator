# Healthcare Plan Navigator - Fix Summary

## What Was Broken
The forensic analysis revealed a **"Potemkin Village" implementation** where:
- PDF extraction failed for 94% of files (regex patterns didn't match Healthcare.gov format)
- All costs extracted as $0.00
- All plans received identical scores (4.85/10)
- MCP integration was fake (never imported or used)
- API integrations were placeholders

## What We Fixed

### 1. PDF Extraction (PARTIAL SUCCESS ‚úÖ)
**Before:** Old regex patterns failed to match Healthcare.gov PDF format
**After:** New patterns successfully extract data from **19 out of 33 files (58%)**

#### Successfully Parsing PDFs:
- ‚úÖ All Gold plans (Premium: $60-98, Deductible: $1500, OOP: $7800)
- ‚úÖ All Silver Standard plans (Premium: $19-34, Deductible: $500, OOP: $3000)
- ‚úÖ Most Silver CSR plans (Premium: $0-69, Deductible: $0-500, OOP: $3000-3050)
- ‚úÖ Plan overview pages

#### Still Broken:
- ‚ùå All DOCX files (14 files) - different text format needs separate handling
- These parse but extract $0 values

### 2. Issuer Name Extraction (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Before:** Garbage text like "for any past year coverage"
**After:** Proper issuer names: "Ambetter", "Blue Cross Blue Shield", "UnitedHealthcare", etc.

### 3. Plan ID Extraction (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Before:** Random text fragments
**After:** Proper Healthcare.gov format IDs like "91450AZ0080124"

### 4. Metal Level Detection (FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Before:** Defaulted to Silver for everything
**After:** Correctly identifies Gold, Silver, Bronze, Platinum from text/filename

## What's Still Broken

### 1. Scoring Engine (NEEDS INVESTIGATION üî¥)
Despite having varied input data now, all plans still get identical scores (4.85/10)
- Provider network score: Always 0.0 (no provider data in PDFs)
- Medication coverage: Always 2.0 (no formulary data)
- Total cost score: Always 10.0 (seems broken)
- This needs further investigation

### 2. DOCX Parsing (NEEDS SEPARATE FIX üü°)
DOCX files have different internal text format than PDFs
- 14 out of 33 files are DOCX
- They parse but extract $0 values
- Need separate extraction patterns for DOCX

### 3. MCP Integration (NEVER IMPLEMENTED üî¥)
- Configuration exists but tools never imported
- Should either implement or remove claims

## Impact of Fixes

### Before Fixes:
- 1 file worked correctly (3%)
- 32 files extracted zeros (97%)
- All scores identical
- Garbage issuer names

### After Fixes:
- 19 files work correctly (58%)
- 14 files still extract zeros (42%)
- Scores still identical (separate issue)
- Proper issuer names and IDs

## Next Steps

1. **Fix DOCX extraction** - Add separate patterns for Word doc format
2. **Debug scoring engine** - Why are scores identical despite varied inputs?
3. **Remove theatrical code** - Delete fake MCP/API integration claims
4. **Add validation** - Reject plans with all-zero values

## Files Modified

1. `src/healthplan_navigator/core/ingest.py` - Fixed PDF extraction patterns
2. `main_verified.py` - Created minimal pipeline with execution proofs
3. `forensic_test.py` - Created verification tests

## Verification

Run `python main_verified.py` to see:
- 19 plans now extract real premium/deductible values
- Issuer names are correct
- But scores still need fixing

The core issue was **broken PDF extraction patterns**. We've fixed 58% of files, proving the pipeline CAN work with proper data extraction.
