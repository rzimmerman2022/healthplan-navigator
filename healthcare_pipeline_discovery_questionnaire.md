## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION

### 🔴 BLOCKERS
| Issue | Code Location | Question | Impact |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Incorrect client attribute reference | `analyzer.py:217` | Should ZIP be accessed via `client.personal.zipcode` not `client.personal_info.zipcode`? | Healthcare.gov API calls fail completely |
| SQL injection vulnerability | `healthcare_gov.py:334` | Must parameterize CMS query - ZIP code inserted directly into SQL string? | Security risk, malformed queries |
| Silent parsing failures | `ingest.py:50,64,77` | Should document parsing errors be logged and surfaced to caller? | Data loss without notification |

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY  
| Issue | Code Location | Question | Impact |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------|
| No ZIP code validation | Multiple files | What ZIP format validation and error handling is required? | Invalid API calls, inconsistent behavior |
| Missing input sanitization | Various | Should all user inputs be validated/sanitized? | Potential security and reliability issues |
| Hardcoded business rules | `score.py:194-224` | Should scoring thresholds be configurable? | Inflexible business logic |

## APPENDIX: CODE SNIPPETS REQUIRING REVIEW

### Critical Bug - Incorrect Attribute Access
```python
# analyzer.py:217 - BROKEN
zipcode = getattr(self._current_client.personal_info, 'zipcode', None)

# Should be:
zipcode = getattr(self._current_client.personal, 'zipcode', None)
```

### SQL Injection Risk
```python
# healthcare_gov.py:334 - UNSAFE  
query = f"""
WHERE "ServiceAreaId" LIKE '%{zipcode[:3]}%'
"""

# Should use parameterized queries
```

### Silent Error Handling
```python
# ingest.py:50 - NO ERROR PROPAGATION
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error parsing {file_path}: {e}")
    # Continues without notifying caller of failure
```
