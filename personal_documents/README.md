## üì• How to Add Your Documents

### Option 1: Direct File Copy
1. Download your plan documents from Healthcare.gov
2. Copy or move them into this `personal_documents` folder
3. No renaming required - the system reads any supported file

### Option 2: Drag and Drop
1. Open this folder in your file explorer
2. Drag plan documents directly into the folder
3. The system will automatically detect new files

### Option 3: Command Line
```bash
# Copy a single file
cp ~/Downloads/YourPlan.pdf ./personal_documents/

# Copy multiple PDFs
cp ~/Downloads/*.pdf ./personal_documents/

# Move files instead of copying
mv ~/Downloads/HealthPlan*.pdf ./personal_documents/
```

## üöÄ Running Analysis

Once your documents are in this folder, you have several options:

### Quick Analysis with Demo Script
```bash
# From the project root directory
python demo.py
```
This will:
- Use the sample client profile
- Analyze all documents in this folder
- Generate comprehensive reports in the `output` directory

### Custom Client Profile
```bash
# Edit sample_client.json first with your information
python -m healthplan_navigator.cli --client sample_client.json --plans-dir ./personal_documents
```

### Analyze Specific Files
```bash
# Analyze only certain files
python -m healthplan_navigator.cli --sample-client --plans ./personal_documents/Plan1.pdf ./personal_documents/Plan2.pdf
```

## üìä What Happens to Your Documents

1. **Parsing**: Documents are read and key information is extracted
2. **Analysis**: Plans are scored across 6 metrics based on your needs
3. **Reporting**: Results are saved to the `output` folder
4. **Privacy**: Original documents remain unchanged in this folder

## üóÇÔ∏è Organization Tips

### Recommended Naming Convention (Optional)
While not required, organizing files can help you track analyses:
```
2025_Gold_BlueCross_HMO.pdf
2025_Silver_Aetna_PPO.pdf
2025_Bronze_United_EPO.pdf
```

### Subfolder Organization (Optional)
You can create subfolders for better organization:
```
personal_documents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_plans/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gold_plans/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ silver_plans/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bronze_plans/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ formularies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ provider_directories/
```

The system will recursively search all subfolders if you use the `--recursive` flag.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### File Size Limits
- Maximum recommended file size: 50MB per document
- For larger files, consider splitting or extracting relevant pages

### Document Quality
- **Best results**: Official Healthcare.gov documents
- **Good results**: Insurance company plan summaries
- **Variable results**: Scanned documents (OCR may be needed)

### Sensitive Information
- The system only extracts plan-related information
- Personal identifiers in documents are ignored
- No data is stored permanently outside the `output` folder

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Document Not Recognized
If a document isn't being parsed:
1. Verify it's a supported format (.pdf, .docx, .json, .csv)
2. Check the file isn't corrupted
3. Ensure the file contains plan information

### Parsing Errors
If you see parsing errors:
1. The document might be password-protected
2. The PDF might be a scanned image (not searchable)
3. The format might not match expected patterns

### No Documents Found
If the analysis reports no documents:
1. Verify files are in this `personal_documents` folder
2. Check file extensions are correct
3. Ensure files aren't hidden (starting with .)

## üìù Document Checklist

For best analysis results, try to include:

- [ ] **Benefits Summary**: What's covered and copays
- [ ] **Provider Directory**: Or list of your doctors

- Photos of documents taken with phone
- Password-protected PDSs
- Corrupted or damaged files

### Naming Convention

For best results, use this naming pattern:
```
[Year]_[Tier]_[Insurer]_[Type]_[Identifier].pdf

Examples:
2025_Gold_BlueCross_HMO_Summary_Plan123.pdf
2025_Silver_Aetna_PPO_Benefits_XYZ456.pdf
2025_Bronze_Kaiser_HMO_Formulary_ABC789.pdf
```

### Security and Privacy

#### Before Adding Documents
- Remove or redact personal information if sharing for testing
- Use sample/demo names instead of real names
- Consider using pseudonyms for provider names

#### File Permissions (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 personal_documents/*.pdf  # Owner read/write only
chmod 700 personal_documents/       # Owner access only
```

#### Windows Security
- Right-click folder ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Security
- Remove access for unnecessary users
- Consider encrypting sensitive documents

### Troubleshooting Document Issues

#### "Document Not Recognized"
1. Verify file format (.pdf, .docx, .json, .csv)
2. Check file isn't corrupted (try opening manually)
3. Ensure file contains plan information (not just marketing)

#### "Poor Text Extraction"
1. Document may be scanned image - run through OCR
2. Try converting DOCX to PDF
3. Check if PDF has selectable text

#### "Missing Information"
1. Add multiple documents per plan for complete picture
2. Ensure plan summary document is included
3. Check document dates match analysis year

### Document Organization Tips

#### Single Plan Analysis
